The API reference documentation provides detailed information about a function or object in Node.js. This documentation indicates what arguments a method accepts, the return value of that method, and what errors may be related to that method. It also indicates which methods are available for different versions of Node.js.

<p>
An error in the request stream presents itself by emitting an 'error' event on the stream. If you don't have a listener for that event, the error will be thrown, which could crash your Node.js program. You should therefore add an 'error' listener on your request streams, even if you just log it and continue on your way. (Though it's probably best to send some kind of HTTP error response. More on that later.)
